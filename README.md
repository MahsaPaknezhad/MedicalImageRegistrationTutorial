# Tutorial For VoxelMorph: a Deep-learning Based Registration Method

This tutorial is prepared by [Adrian Dalca](http://adalca.mit.edu) and Andrew Hoopes to get you started with [VoxelMorph](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph), a deep-learning based registration algorithm.

### The tutorial includes:
- **Image registration for MNIST**   
We will first learn to deal with data, building a model, training, registration and generalization
- **Image registration for Brain MRI (2D slices)**  
We will then show how these models work for 2d slices of brain scans, presenting a more complex scenario    
- **Image registration for realistic 3D Brain MRI**  
We will illustrate full 3D registration

This repository contains a slightly simplified version of the original tutorial. The original tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/learn2reg/tutorials2019/blob/master/unsupervised/unsupervised_core.ipynb)
